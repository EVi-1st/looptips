# Exercise

Hands-down, exercise is the most commonly discussed topic of long-term Loop users.  Exercise is highly specific to an individual and its impact on blood sugar is not always equal.  For example, many people find anaerobic exercise such as weight lifting will raise blood glucose, and aerobic exercise such as running will lower blood glucose.  The degree to which impacts are observed also depends on the insulin and carbohydrates on board going into the exercise.
