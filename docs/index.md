# GitHub


## Introduction

The official description of [GitHub](https://github.com) from their own website is "GitHub is a a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere."  

If you're just an average Joe (like myself), GitHub may look quite foreign, use words that are confusing and you may get somewhat lost.  Definitely doesn't inspire collaboration if you are afraid you'll mess something up in the process.  So, I'm putting together these docs in an effort to make things slightly less intimidating and hoepfully, you'll feel more confident to use GitHub to your advantage.

## T1D projects

There are LOADS of projects in GitHub that are specific to our T1D community.  There are some that are readily recognizable, like Nightscout, and there are others that are building blocks of projects, such as Decocare for OpenAPS.  Since the "We Are Not Waiting" community is spread across the globe, GitHub provides the coders and others an easy way to collaborate without needing to be physically nearby.

Some of the projects most of us have come to know:

* Loop
* OpenAPS
* Nightscout
