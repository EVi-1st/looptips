# Introduction


Welcome to LoopTips!  The purpose of these pages is to help you make the most of your DIY closed-looping experience.  In particular, these pages support users of the [Loop app](https://loopdocs.org).  These documents have been a long time in the making and as always, your feedback is welcome.  If you have comments, please feel free to provide input at the [Looped Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/TheLoopedGroup/?fref=nf)  or in [Loop's Zulipchat](https://loop.zulipchat.com).

LoopTips is a companion to the LoopDocs.   LoopTips does not cover the build or installation of Loop app.  If you have problems with building your Loop app, or troubleshooting the technical aspects of Loop operations, please head over to the LoopDocs for help.  The pages here are specifically related to understanding how your loop is recommending the actions being taken, and how you can improve your blood glucose outcomes on Loop.

# What is a closed loop?

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) helps define an "artificial pancreas device system" (aka closed loop system) with this cool graphic and text from their website [here](https://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/productsandmedicalprocedures/homehealthandconsumer/consumerproducts/artificialpancreas/ucm259548.htm#illustration).

>"Most Artificial Pancreas Device Systems consists of three types of devices already familiar to many people with diabetes: a continuous glucose monitoring system (CGM) and an insulin infusion pump. A blood glucose device (such as a glucose meter) is used to calibrate the CGM.

>A computer-controlled algorithm connects the CGM and insulin infusion pump to allow continuous communication between the two devices. Sometimes an artificial pancreas device system is referred to as a "closed-loop" system, an "automated insulin delivery" system, or an "autonomous system for glycemic control."

>An Artificial Pancreas Device System will not only monitor glucose levels in the body but also automatically adjust the delivery of insulin to reduce high blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia) and minimize the incidence of low blood glucose (hypoglycemia) with little or no input from the patient."

Closed loop systems are the "next best thing" coming to the diabetes market...and we've all been waiting for their development.  There are currently only two commercial closed loop systems available.  Medtronic's 670G system was approved by FDA in Fall 2016 and is on the market currently.  The 670G is advertised as "learning" a person's insulin sensitivity and improving time-in-range through automated basal delivery adjustments.  Tadem's Basal IQ has also been approved and is on the market.  The Basal-IQ offers predictive low glucose suspend; in essence, the hypoglycemia-reducing part of a closed loop system.

# What is Loop?

The Loop system is a do-it-yourself closed loop, developed through the work of community volunteers.  (You can read about the history of Loop development in LoopDocs.)  Just because Loop is DIY doesn't mean that the designers have taken shortcuts on user experiences.  Loop strives to keep the same high standard (or better) that a commercially-developed system should be expected to deliver.  Loop aims to relieve the burden of diabetes management through:

* safely recommending automated insulin delivery adjustments based on current CGM data
* user-interface that streamlines the users' time in the app
* minimizing excessive alerts or notifications to avoid alarm fatigue and inattention
* easy to understand graphics
* no internet dependence

As exciting as this sounds...we should first get the disappointments out of the way.  There are some limitations on what kind of pumps/equipment are required.  This system doesn't work with most pumps and requires you to do some work (directions are thoroughly covered in LoopDocs).

* Loop only works on an iPhone
* Loop only works with older Medtronic pumps
* Medtronic x15 series (all work)
* Medtronic x22 series (all work)
* Medtronic x23 series (2.4A or lower)
* Medtronic x54 series (WW: 2.6A or lower and Canadian/Australian: 2.7A or lower)
* You need access to a Mac computer to build Loop app onto your iPhone
* You need to buy a RileyLink ($150) and a developer license ($99 per year)

And while it may seem obvious (it still bears mentioning):

* Loop does not make insulin act any faster
