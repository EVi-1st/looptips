# Adjusting Your Settings

But what about diabetes?

Of course, as soon as you test and dial-in all these things, diabetes will throw you a curve ball and change your insulin needs.  That's the way it works.  It's not just YDMV (your diabetes may vary), it's actually YDWV (your diabetes will vary).  So how do you adjust settings without needing to open loop every time?  Short answer: it takes practice.

For us personally, hormones play the largest variable in settings.  If we estimate average basal rate of about 1 u/hr for Anna, hormones can make her range from 0.55 to 3 u/hr.  Illness or heat can make her ISF change from typical 35 to a range between 30-45.  We have gotten used to changing settings (basal rates mostly) to accommodate hormone fluctuations.  Illness and heat we tend to use shorter-term fixes like temp targets to help rather than changing settings.

One of the easiest tells we have that basals need to change is hanging out above/below target with positive/negative IOB.  Here's one recent example.  During the day before this screenshot, Anna was busy with some stressful things at school...like being front and center during the school's pep rally for Homecoming around noon to 2pm.  So, the unusual red spot on her graph didn't immediately make me think anything was "wrong".  Then she went to Homecoming dance that night, hung a little higher than target, but nothing too bad and she wasn't looping during dance (her choice).  She came home around midnight, and at about 5am I noticed that she was hanging out steady at about 130s and carrying positive IOB.  Fingerstick showed she was at 195 (thanks Dexcom).  Gave a correction and started to wonder if may her basals were too low, because she shouldn't have been that high under normal operations (but maybe homecoming dance was to blame?).  I didn't make any changes to her settings at this point, but did start to watch for signs.


In the morning, Anna had a typical breakfast with some toast and fruit.  With fiasp, she hasn't really been going above 150 (and usually not above 130)...so when she hit nearly 180 for the meal, I definitely started to think basals may indeed be low...but I waited to see how the meal would land.


As you can see above, about 2.5 hours after her meal of fairly quick carbs, she started to rise.  And she started to rise with about 0.75 units IOB.  This is odd for her.  Ideally, we wouldn't be seeing sharp, steady rises with a good amount of IOB.  Additionally, this meal didn't have protein or fat involved so I knew the rise wasn't a late food contribution (even if Loop had some cob still on board).

So, once it looked like (1) the rise really wasn't slowing down even like Loop thought it should, (2) she was climing with fiasp for nearly an hour of high temping with (3) positive IOB...then I finally decided to adjust basals.  I moved her basals from 0.85 to 1.2 u/hr.  Why that number?  A guess based on basal rates she tends to move between during her regular variations.  Trial and error have shown us that a rate slightly above 1 u/hour is usually needed sometimes.



One of the things I like to watch is the IOB pill when we make a basal change.  Ideally, I like to get the IOB back to a number that is roughly how much I think may help get a correction going again.  So, changing the basals from 0.85 to 1.2, Loop recalculated IOB from 0.52 to -0.48.  Which was roughly in line with what I'd expect...Anna was about 27 mg/dl over her 95 mg/dl target with an ISF of 55...meaning she'd need about 0.49 units to correct to target.  Perfect...seemed like a reasonable amount of movement for basals then.  Loop started running a high temp and I wait to see how things look in about 2 hours.



About 1.5 hours later, Anna wasn't quite coming down as fast as I would've expected. She was still holding 0.57 IOB and at same BG as she was 80 minutes before.  So...I waited a bit and adjusted again to 1.4 u/hour.  Again, just a guess, but nearly two hours after that adjustment we are sitting just about at target and just about even IOB.  I'll probably split the baby and use 1.3 u/hr going forward.

So...that's how I look for and make tweaks to my settings while closed looping.  The basis is knowing what "good" times look like and how foods normally behave.  Open-loop testing really helps with that.  Then, when you find yourself with some of the telltale signs (food going differently than expected, BGs holding steady but not at target, moving up/down without IOB helping, etc) over an extended period of time, you can make small adjustments and watch for the resulting behaviors.  I don't adjust based on just one meal or one period of above-target BGs.  There's too often another reason (stress, sensor issues, etc) that could explain a short term high/low BG pattern...but if I notice the trend continuing for a period of time/several meals, I adjust.  Shorter term issues from stress or exercise we deal with using temp targets or just have a little more patience and wait for them to come down when the issue has passed.
