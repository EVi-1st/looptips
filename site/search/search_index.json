Sometimes an artificial pancreas device system is referred to as a \"closed-loop\" system, an \"automated insulin delivery\" system, or an \"autonomous system for glycemic control.\" An Artificial Pancreas Device System will not only monitor glucose levels in the body but also automatically adjust the delivery of insulin to reduce high blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia) and minimize the incidence of low blood glucose (hypoglycemia) with little or no input from the patient.\" What is Loop? \u2301 The Loop app is a do-it-yourself closed loop algorithm and user interface, developed through the work of community volunteers.

These settings include: basal rate schedule insulin sensitivitiy factor (ISF) carb ratio duration of insulin action (DIA) correction/target range Typically, most people with type 1 diabetes consult with their endocrinologist to develop and revise their settings. The endocrinologist usually reviews the patient's glucose and treatment history at each appointment to assess whether settings need to be adjusted. There are several great books available about the topic (Think Like A Pancreas, etc) Why settings still matter \u2301 Loop is primarily a set of math equations called an algorithm. The recommendations and actions that Loop takes are based on that algorithm, and the settings you enter in your Loop app are the basis for that math. Let's start by thinking about basal rates. A well-adjusted basal schedule is designed to keep your BG steady throughout the day, everything else being equal. So...if you were to not eat, not exercise, and basically keep a mellow lifestyle...basals should keep your BGs steady. That is how Loop's math starts, and it's an important point to remember as you use and learn your Loop app. Loop's math is based on the assumption that the basal schedule you have provided in your settings are capable of keeping your BGs steady in the absence of other stressors. So as your BGs go out of range for an unusual short-term influence like stress, exercise, or unannounced carbs, Loop will apply corrective insulin (via temp basal) adjustments to bring your BGs back to target. With all the excitement about automated insulin delivery, some people mistakenly assume that the user's settings don't matter anymore....that everything is automated. However, settings do still matter as they provide the basis for Loop's math. Diabetes is not a static math equation. What worked for basals, insulin sensitivity, or carb ratios yesterday...well, that might not work today. The degree that those variations happen can affect your looping experience. Let's give some examples to help. When you calculate a meal bolus, your math probably looks similar to this: But many times you are probably adjusting that math based on any number of \"factors\" that you are aware could be affecting your BG. Diatribe put together this great list of factors that affect BGs, and therefore could also affect how you'd adjust your insulin delivery from what they otherwise would normally be. Some of those factors you are already used to making allowances for, such as: Pizza boluses...You probably are accustomed to needing an extended bolus and/or higher temp basal rate to help with the late BG spike common after the initial bolus starts to wear off. That pizza takes a long time to digest thanks to those slow-acting fats. Medications...How about that time that you had to take steroids for an achy joint? Those steroids probably resulted in a dramatic overall increase in insulin needs for several days, and you had to set aggressive temp basal increases or other settings adjustments. Hormones...monthly hormone cycles have many women adjusting their basal rates and/or insulin sensitivity schedules for a week or so each month. Exercise...always a tough one because some exercise may make your BG rise (lifting weights) and other exercise may make your BG drop (running). Through repetition, most people have learned how to adjust for exercise by using temp basal rates or timing of meals/boluses. The degree to which Loop can deal with those factors is largely dependent on the duration of the \"factor\" itself and how well we can communicate to Loop that those factors are at play. For things we know are coming, we can tell Loop in advance, and Loop has ways of dealing with them mathematically. In the pizza example, Loop lets us mark the meal as long, slow digestion and therefore better react to a potential late BG rise. For exercise, we can use temporary targets before/after exercise to help Loop administer less insulin for awhile. If, however, your insulin needs are impacted by something unnanouced such as horomone cycles, stress, or illness then sometimes your Loop may not be able to consistently hold you at your target BG range. You may end up holding steady at a higher BG than you'd prefer. This is because Loop's math is still using the inputs that were from before you got sick/stressed/horomone'd (new word). Then the decision becomes \"Do you adjust your settings now or just wait it out until the stressor goes away?\" What if settings are \"off\"? \u2301 If the inputs to those math equations (aka your settings) are not accurate, your results for blood glucose control may also not be optimal. Let's use an analogy to explain the impact of settings. Imagine your are trying to keep a house plant healthy. If you water it \"just right\", the plant is green and lush. After much trial and error, you've discovered that 1/3 cup of water every other day is \"just right\". Everything is beautiful...plant is happy. Until, your mom decided to move the plant into the warmest room of the house. Now the plant's soil is evaporating water at a quicker rate. You notice this is leaving the plant stressed and not quite as perky looking. If you continued to water just 1/3 cup of water every other day...the plant would not be as healthy as it was in the cooler room. What changed? The underlying need for water changed due to a stressor (hotter room). Knowing that there was a stressor, you have some options: Keep the same watering schedule. Before choosing this option you might want to know how long your mom is staying. If she will be gone soon and you can move the plant back into the cooler room, maybe you choose this option. The affect on the plant, while not ideal, will be short-lived and you just don't want to deal with mom-drama about plant locations. Ride out the short-term stress. Increase your watering schedule. If mom is going to be visiting for a long time, it might be best to adjust your watering schedule. You might not be quite sure how much, but you know it's something. You can periodically check in on the plant and soil moisture to see how it is responding to a little more water. Much like the plant and its watering schedule, your basic insulin settings are what keeps your BGs steady without stessors present. For much of the time, the stressors in type 1 are short-lived and temporary (we just ride them out)...carb count a little off, math test in fourth period, public speaking engagement, etc. Loop does well helping with the short-term stressors. They don't represent a prolonged need to change settings and the BG-impacts are short-lived. However, the longer term stressors are often helped by settings adjustments. Examples of longer term stressors are medications, illness, hormones, travel, or altitude. By letting Loop know that the status quo has changed (more/less insulin is needed overall) will help BGs get and stay in range. If you have told Loop that your insulin need is 1 unit/hour, but in reality you're needing 1.3 units/hour because you've traveled to a colder place and will be sedentary for days...you will likely find yourself steady but higher than your target range while looping. The high temp basals that Loop will be providing in an attempt to bring you back to target will simply be going to fill the lack of adequate basal scheduled. If you update your basal schedule to reflect 1.3 units/hour of basal needs, Loop would be better positioned to provide needed insulin delivery to keep you in target range. Automated settings adjustments \u2301 A common sentiment among new Loop users goes something like \"Why doesn't Loop see that I'm stuck on a high BG? Why doesn't it bring me back to my target BG?\" What's actually being implied is that the user thinks Loop should be doing some sort of retrospective analysis on the user's BG and data to make a \"better\" decision. The user wants Loop to learn from recent data. There is a short-term retrospective analysis built into Loop which will apply a weighted-correction based on the past 60 minutes of BG changes. However, larger-scale \"learning\" is not currently a part of Loop's algorithm. Perhaps in subsequent versions of Loop, auto-adjustment of settings or machine learning will be incorporated. Until then, you will need to tell Loop if your plant has moved long-term to a warmer room ;)","title":"Overview"},{"location":"settings/overview/#overview","text":"In the context of the following discussion, the term \"settings\" refers to information that the user has typically entered into their pump.

If, however, your insulin needs are impacted by something unnanouced such as horomone cycles, stress, or illness then sometimes your Loop may not be able to consistently hold you at your target BG range. You may end up holding steady at a higher BG than you'd prefer. This is because Loop's math is still using the inputs that were from before you got sick/stressed/horomone'd (new word). Then the decision becomes \"Do you adjust your settings now or just wait it out until the stressor goes away?\"","title":"Why settings still matter"},{"location":"settings/overview/#what-if-settings-are-off","text":"If the inputs to those math equations (aka your settings) are not accurate, your results for blood glucose control may also not be optimal. Let's use an analogy to explain the impact of settings. Imagine your are trying to keep a house plant healthy. If you water it \"just right\", the plant is green and lush. After much trial and error, you've discovered that 1/3 cup of water every other day is \"just right\". Everything is beautiful...plant is happy. Until, your mom decided to move the plant into the warmest room of the house. Now the plant's soil is evaporating water at a quicker rate. You notice this is leaving the plant stressed and not quite as perky looking. If you continued to water just 1/3 cup of water every other day...the plant would not be as healthy as it was in the cooler room. What changed? The underlying need for water changed due to a stressor (hotter room). Knowing that there was a stressor, you have some options: Keep the same watering schedule. Before choosing this option you might want to know how long your mom is staying. If she will be gone soon and you can move the plant back into the cooler room, maybe you choose this option. The affect on the plant, while not ideal, will be short-lived and you just don't want to deal with mom-drama about plant locations. Ride out the short-term stress. Increase your watering schedule. If mom is going to be visiting for a long time, it might be best to adjust your watering schedule. You might not be quite sure how much, but you know it's something. You can periodically check in on the plant and soil moisture to see how it is responding to a little more water. Much like the plant and its watering schedule, your basic insulin settings are what keeps your BGs steady without stessors present. For much of the time, the stressors in type 1 are short-lived and temporary (we just ride them out)...carb count a little off, math test in fourth period, public speaking engagement, etc. Loop does well helping with the short-term stressors. They don't represent a prolonged need to change settings and the BG-impacts are short-lived. However, the longer term stressors are often helped by settings adjustments. Examples of longer term stressors are medications, illness, hormones, travel, or altitude. By letting Loop know that the status quo has changed (more/less insulin is needed overall) will help BGs get and stay in range. If you have told Loop that your insulin need is 1 unit/hour, but in reality you're needing 1.3 units/hour because you've traveled to a colder place and will be sedentary for days...you will likely find yourself steady but higher than your target range while looping. The high temp basals that Loop will be providing in an attempt to bring you back to target will simply be going to fill the lack of adequate basal scheduled. If you update your basal schedule to reflect 1.3 units/hour of basal needs, Loop would be better positioned to provide needed insulin delivery to keep you in target range.","title":"What if settings are \"off\"?"},{"location":"settings/overview/#automated-settings-adjustments","text":"A common sentiment among new Loop users goes something like \"Why doesn't Loop see that I'm stuck on a high BG? Why doesn't it bring me back to my target BG?\" What's actually being implied is that the user thinks Loop should be doing some sort of retrospective analysis on the user's BG and data to make a \"better\" decision. The user wants Loop to learn from recent data. There is a short-term retrospective analysis built into Loop which will apply a weighted-correction based on the past 60 minutes of BG changes. However, larger-scale \"learning\" is not currently a part of Loop's algorithm. Perhaps in subsequent versions of Loop, auto-adjustment of settings or machine learning will be incorporated. Until then, you will need to tell Loop if your plant has moved long-term to a warmer room ;)","title":"Automated settings adjustments"},{"location":"settings/settings/","text":"Initial Settings \u2301 Here's how 90% of Loopers start: Switch from their existing pump over to a Loop-compatible Medtronic pump Within hours, they begin closed loop use of the Loop app When BGs aren't as smooth as hoped for, Looper begins to try to adjust settings while still in closed loop The problem with this sequence is that adjusting settings on the fly while in closed loop can be difficult as a new user. Here are some recommendations to help make the transition to closed Loop easier. The first place to start is with getting the best initial settings as you can. Try Open Looping first \u2301 If I could offer one bit of really useful advice, it would be to open loop for at least a few days and don't accept any of the temp basal recommendations from Loop. Just watch and get used to the Loop program. Adjust to the user interface and buttons you'll be pressing. This breaking-in phase will also let you get used to the Medtronic pump and sites. If there are differences between how your body absorbs insulin from your old pump vs the Medtronic pump, open looping will be a good way to notice those before adding the complexity of automated corrections from Loop. If you want extra credit points to help, you can read some excellent books about pump settings and what they mean. For example, Think Like a Pancreas is a great reference for understanding some of the guiding principles in pump therapy. Let me summarize the important parts about pump settings: Basal rates should keep your BGs steady in the absence of other influences (such as food, medications, etc). Boluses should return your BGs to target after a meal. ISF should be the amount one unit of insulin drops your BGs without other influences. DIA is the duration of insulin action, how long the insulin is affecting BGs It is absolutely possible to have two wrong settings look like right settings when they balance out. The problem is that those wrong settings won't balance out in all situations...and looping will not be smooth in those situations. Example: Too low of basals can be offset by regular eating of meals with too strong of a carb ratio. If you stop eating though, you'll start going high because that extra insulin from the meal boluses won't be there to help the lack of basals. Taking the time to validate your settings by truly testing them is really good practice before closing loop. 1st: Insulin Duration \u2301 The majority of pumpers have used DIA at about 3 hours on traditional pump therapy. There's a reason for that. In traditional pump use, DIA is only used to calculate the remaining IOB at any given time after a bolus. That's it. And when do we use remaining IOB in traditional pump therapy? Usually when we want to give a correction because a BG is stuck high or going low...in other words, DIA is used as a rough approximation to correct off-target BGs. It doesn't have to be rocket science then...we're making an approximation because some other numbers (carb count, basals, etc) weren't behaving the way we were expecting either and therefore leading to an off-target BG. But in looping, DIA plays a huge role in how Loop is anticipating and evaluating your BG movement. DIA is used to calculate how much insulin is remaining in your system (aka insulin on board, IOB) to potentially move your BGs. IOB is used literally every single loop calculation for what temp basal or bolus to recommend. Not only that, but the strength of the insulin at any given time is also being used. Closed-loops know and care about whether your insulin was given recently and is due to peak soon (like between 60-90 minutes with novolog/humalog), or if it is in the slow tail portion hours later where BG impacts are going to be way less dramatic. So, DIA means a lot in your closed-looping world. What will happen if you use too short of a DIA in closed-looping? You'll see it in a variety of ways, but too short a DIA will give the equivalent of insulin-stacking. The loops will be assuming insulin is disappearing faster than it actually is. If you are getting steady BGs while closed looping with a short DIA, it's likely that your basals are being set too low to compensate. If instead you have your basals correctly set and use a short DIA in closed-looping, you will likely find yourself going low from corrections. One good indication of this is going lower than target carrying negative IOB from previous loop low/zero temp basals. General recommendation: Do not keep using your old, short DIA from traditional pump therapy days. Use one of Loop's exponential insulin curves (Rapid Acting adult/child or Fiasp) and their default DIA of 6 hours. This will help prevent insulin stacking as you begin Loop. 2nd: Basals \u2301 Now that you have a reasonable DIA and insulin model selected, make sure to test your basals. Establishing a quality basal schedule is setting yourself up for successful looping. Personally, we find testing basals can be pretty painless and doesn't require days of fasting. Instead, we look for easy opportunities. If you are willing to open-loop test, that is going to give the most accurate information in the quickest way. It's a pretty easy test. Turn off your loop. Don't eat food, don't do crazy exercise, don't sit in a hot tub. Just have a relaxing average time period and see if your basals are able to hold you roughly steady. Doesn't matter if you are at target or not...the idea is to simply have zero extra insulin on board from any boluses or corrections and watch what happens during those hours. Typically we like to see about 3-4 hours of BGs without the influence of food boluses or activity. Many people, especially little kids, are not enthusiastic about fasting basal testing...so look for opportunities to make it less cumbersome if you have to eat during the test. For example, use a low carb meal/snack that you know how to bolus for (or doesn't need a bolus at all) and generally needs no corrections. For us...that's two extra large scrambled eggs (or three small ones) with cheese bolused at 8g. If she eats that meal, the BG response is slow and measured and by 3 hours after that meal...the bolus and food effects are really muted and we can start watching to see if BGs stay pretty steady for the next two hours. For example, here's some of a recent open-loop basal testing we did with Anna...confirmed that the BGs could stay pretty steady without the involvement of temp basal help from looping. 3rd: Insulin sensitivity factor \u2301 Insulin sensitivity factor (ISF) is the next logical setting to test. If you've just done the basal test and gotten steady BGs with an open loop...try taking a glucose tab or two. Wait for your BGs to be steady at the higher BG, and give a safe correction that you think will get you close to target. Watch the resulting BG drop over the next 2-3 hours. You should see BGs come to a steady level again. How much did the BG drop? How many units of insulin did you use? Divide the two numbers and you will have your ISF. If your BG dropped 15 mg/dl with half unit of insulin, your ISF is approximately 30 mg/dl/unit. If your ISF is too weak (in other words the actual number is too low compared to reality of how strong the insulin is) in closed-looping, one of the most common symptoms you'll see is a roller coaster of BGs where the temp basals are cycling between zero and high temping. I'm going to borrow a couple of example graphs from Looped group. These are examples where too weak of ISF is more than likely a large factor in the roller-coaster (doesn't mean it is the only culprit, and is more difficult to ferret out when food is involved like the second graph). But, lightning bolt high temp basals followed by very quick BG drops and zero temps is usually too weak of ISF...raise the ISF number to help looping know that each unit of insulin is actually doing more BG dropping. 4th: Carb Ratios \u2301 Now that you have basals, ISF, and DIA all set-up...here's where it gets really tempting to close loop and move on. And, truthfully, it's not that hard to test carb ratios on a closed loop vs an open loop if you've solidly tested all these other factors. A good carb ratio will bring your BGs back to the starting point of the meal within about 3 hours or so. A bad carb ratio will leave you higher or lower than the starting point of the meal. For example, these are two examples of carb ratios being too strong. In this first example, there's 2.27 units of IOB and BGs are at 103 and headed down at a pretty good clip at about 2 hours after the meal. If the next meal hadn't been eaten then, low treatment certainly would've been needed. This next graph also shows too aggressive of a carb ratio. Three hours after the meal, there's nearly 0.50 units IOB, BG is well below where the meal started, and definitely low treatments needed. If you are finding that a correct carb ratio is yielding good BGs 3 hours later, but you aren't happy with the peak BGs during the meal...then it may be time to explore increasing or adding prebolusing time to your meal or implementing \"eating soon\" targets an hour before meals to help control the post-meal BG spike. Artificially strengthening carb ratios to help control post-meal BG spike will likely yield lows 2-3 hours after a meal. But what about diabetes? Of course, as soon as you test and dial-in all these things, diabetes will throw you a curve ball and change your insulin needs. That's the way it works. It's not just YDMV (your diabetes may vary), it's actually YDWV (your diabetes will vary). So how do you adjust settings without needing to open loop every time? Short answer: it takes practice. For us personally, hormones play the largest variable in settings. If we estimate average basal rate of about 1 u/hr for Anna, hormones can make her range from 0.55 to 3 u/hr. Illness or heat can make her ISF change from typical 35 to a range between 30-45. We have gotten used to changing settings (basal rates mostly) to accommodate hormone fluctuations. Illness and heat we tend to use shorter-term fixes like temp targets to help rather than changing settings. One of the easiest tells we have that basals need to change is hanging out above/below target with positive/negative IOB. Here's one recent example. During the day before this screenshot, Anna was busy with some stressful things at school...like being front and center during the school's pep rally for Homecoming around noon to 2pm. So, the unusual red spot on her graph didn't immediately make me think anything was \"wrong\". Then she went to Homecoming dance that night, hung a little higher than target, but nothing too bad and she wasn't looping during dance (her choice). She came home around midnight, and at about 5am I noticed that she was hanging out steady at about 130s and carrying positive IOB. Fingerstick showed she was at 195 (thanks Dexcom). Gave a correction and started to wonder if may her basals were too low, because she shouldn't have been that high under normal operations (but maybe homecoming dance was to blame?). I didn't make any changes to her settings at this point, but did start to watch for signs. In the morning, Anna had a typical breakfast with some toast and fruit. With fiasp, she hasn't really been going above 150 (and usually not above 130)...so when she hit nearly 180 for the meal, I definitely started to think basals may indeed be low...but I waited to see how the meal would land. As you can see above, about 2.5 hours after her meal of fairly quick carbs, she started to rise. And she started to rise with about 0.75 units IOB. This is odd for her. Ideally, we wouldn't be seeing sharp, steady rises with a good amount of IOB. Additionally, this meal didn't have protein or fat involved so I knew the rise wasn't a late food contribution (even if Loop had some cob still on board). So, once it looked like (1) the rise really wasn't slowing down even like Loop thought it should, (2) she was climing with fiasp for nearly an hour of high temping with (3) positive IOB...then I finally decided to adjust basals. I moved her basals from 0.85 to 1.2 u/hr. Why that number? A guess based on basal rates she tends to move between during her regular variations. Trial and error have shown us that a rate slightly above 1 u/hour is usually needed sometimes. One of the things I like to watch is the IOB pill when we make a basal change. Ideally, I like to get the IOB back to a number that is roughly how much I think may help get a correction going again. So, changing the basals from 0.85 to 1.2, Loop recalculated IOB from 0.52 to -0.48. Which was roughly in line with what I'd expect...Anna was about 27 mg/dl over her 95 mg/dl target with an ISF of 55...meaning she'd need about 0.49 units to correct to target. Perfect...seemed like a reasonable amount of movement for basals then. Loop started running a high temp and I wait to see how things look in about 2 hours. About 1.5 hours later, Anna wasn't quite coming down as fast as I would've expected. She was still holding 0.57 IOB and at same BG as she was 80 minutes before. So...I waited a bit and adjusted again to 1.4 u/hour. Again, just a guess, but nearly two hours after that adjustment we are sitting just about at target and just about even IOB. I'll probably split the baby and use 1.3 u/hr going forward. So...that's how I look for and make tweaks to my settings while closed looping. The basis is knowing what \"good\" times look like and how foods normally behave. Open-loop testing really helps with that. Then, when you find yourself with some of the telltale signs (food going differently than expected, BGs holding steady but not at target, moving up/down without IOB helping, etc) over an extended period of time, you can make small adjustments and watch for the resulting behaviors. I don't adjust based on just one meal or one period of above-target BGs. There's too often another reason (stress, sensor issues, etc) that could explain a short term high/low BG pattern...but if I notice the trend continuing for a period of time/several meals, I adjust. Shorter term issues from stress or exercise we deal with using temp targets or just have a little more patience and wait for them to come down when the issue has passed.","title":"Initial Settings"},{"location":"settings/settings/#initial-settings","text":"Here's how 90% of Loopers start: Switch from their existing pump over to a Loop-compatible Medtronic pump Within hours, they begin closed loop use of the Loop app When BGs aren't as smooth as hoped for, Looper begins to try to adjust settings while still in closed loop The problem with this sequence is that adjusting settings on the fly while in closed loop can be difficult as a new user.

Shorter term issues from stress or exercise we deal with using temp targets or just have a little more patience and wait for them to come down when the issue has passed.","title":"4th: Carb Ratios"},{"location":"settings/test-settings/","text":"Test Your Settings \u2301 Open Looping Fine-Tuning Settings Book settings","title":"Check Settings"},{"location":"settings/test-settings/#test-your-settings","text":"Open Looping Fine-Tuning Settings Book settings","title":"Test Your Settings"}]}
